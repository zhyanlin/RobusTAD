# RobusTAD-v0.1

This is the old version as described in https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/293175v1. We used it in our RefHiC paper.

Please use our newly developed version for the entire TAD prediction instead.

Python implementation of RobusTAD: A Tool for Robust Annotation of Topologically Associating Domain Boundaries

It takes .mcool file or text file as input and output both left and right TAD boundary scores in a .bed file.

plain text input format:

chrom   leftbp  rightbp IF
